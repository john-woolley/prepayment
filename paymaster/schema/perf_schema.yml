  ORIG_LTV:

    fnma_type: NUMERIC
    fnma_desc: >-
      The ratio, expressed as a percentage, obtained by dividing the amount of the loan at origination by
      the value of the property.
    fnma_notes: >-
      This field is calculated by dividing the original loan amount by either

        (1) in the case of a purchase, the lower of the sales price of a mortgaged property or its value at the time
        of the sale, or
        (2) in the case of a refinancing, the value of the mortgaged property at the time of refinancing.

      For the purposes of calculating the LTV ratio and determining eligibility for a mortgage loan acquired through a
      HARP refinancing, an appraisal is not required if Fannie Mae waived the property fieldwork requirements to
      establish program eligibility. The disclosed LTV ratio for that loan is based on an estimate of value produced by
      an automated valuation model at the time of the refinance.

      Alternatively, if Fannie Mae did not waive the  property fieldwork requirements, an appraisal can be provided
      to Fannie Mae by the lender to establish program eligibility.

      When an appraisal is obtained and is used to successfully establish HARP program eligibility, it is used
      to calculate the disclosed LTV ratio. Value is reported as null if LTV is >97% or is >200% for a mortgage loan
      acquired through a HARP refinance, or unknown.

        (ii) the amount then currently drawn on a home equity line of credit as of the origination date of
          the underlying mortgage loan, and
        (iii) the outstanding principal balance of any other subordinate mortgage loan as of the origination date of
          the underlying mortgage loan,
      and dividing the resulting sum by the lower of
        (x) the sales price of the mortgaged property and
        (y) the value of the mortgaged property.
